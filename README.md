CDM: The Console Display Manager
================================

Adds on top of `pale3/cdm:0.7`:

 - invocates bin from binlist (`startx ${bin} -- ${serveropts}`, where `${bin}` is the binary selected in the cdm menu)

Invocation
----------

To run cdm, use

    $ cdm [RCFILE]

cdm tries to source configuration files in this order, and uses the first
existing one:

    [RCFILE specified on command line]
    $HOME/.cdmrc
    /etc/cdmrc

To autostart cdm when you log in your account, copy the content of
/usr/share/doc/cdm/profile.sh to the tail of your shell profile (~/.profile,
etc.).


Customisation
-------------

See /etc/cdmrc for examples.
